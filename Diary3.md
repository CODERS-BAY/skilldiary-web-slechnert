# Day 3 of WEB FUN

Honestly, it feels like time to practice was like 4 minutes total, excluding breaks. <br>
The understanding of those things is worthless without practice and practice takes time.<br>
I unfortunately have to say, I feel like the majority of my free time will sink into this ~~piece of shit~~ area of interest.

## Lists

Enjoyable way to not have to use that Breaks all the time
here are ```<ol> | <ul> | <li>``` <br/>whereas ordered lists can have ```type, reverse, start``` attributes <br/>
there are also defined lists with ```<dl>, <dt>, <dd>, <dfn>```<br>
some css is available for it as well <br>
CSS FÃœR LISTEN <br>
list-style-type:
* lower-alpha
* circle
* disc
* square
* decimal-leading-zero
* lower-greek

## Tables
Tbh I am going to go into this topic as soon as I practiced something and/or understood anything.

<br>

## Pseudoclasses
They basically define behaviour of elements under certain conditions, like pressed links, things you hover over etc.

<br>

## Forms
We talked about how forms are used to stucture information that is demanded from a server and sent to a php form file. <br>
That for buttons (radio, checkboxes) and their behaviour were discussed, as labels and placeholders to use them efficiently. <br>
Get / Post and Textfields / Textareas get a honorable mention as well.
