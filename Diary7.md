# Javascript

I saw the first Traversy Media Vanilla Javascript DOM Crash Course!

Not really grasping that stuff, but at least bootstrap and flexboxes aren't doing me bad now, using a combination of bootstrap and css enables me to build sites now. FINALLY.

Curious to see how JavaScript will play into his crap, finally some coding?
