# Javascript

I saw the first Traversy Media Vanilla Javascript DOM Crash Course!

Not really grasping that stuff, but at least bootstrap and flexboxes aren't doing me bad now, using a combination of bootstrap and css enables me to build sites now. FINALLY.

Curious to see how JavaScript will play into his crap, finally some coding? 


# Day2 of JS

This stuff is all a bit overwhelming.
I finally am getting kinda efficient with building the general structure with bootstrap and styling it with css, using JS to do shit is still harsh tho.<br>
Reverse engineering code, taking snippets and adjusting them to do what I want, seems like the way to go for now.<br>

Also ***KEEP THE CONSOLE OPEN TO DEBUG!***
***USE CONSOLE LOG OUTPUTS CONSTANTLY!***
