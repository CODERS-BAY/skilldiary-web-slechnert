Today we were going through the  basics of HTML and CSS.
HTML builds the "Body" or "Skeleton" of a website, whereas CSS is used for styling what is visible.
JavaScript was also briefly mentioned, as tool to make objects interactive or give functionality to the website.

We learned the general structure used in HTML, a few tags and syntax (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>, <a href="#target" id="linkid">, <img src="pic.jpg" alt="description" />).
Then we started playing around with our own .html file and started working through the Schr√∂dinger workbook, chapter 1.

We built a basic website, used some headers and made links to anchors and external pages. Pretty basic and nice to play around with.(Don't forget the fkin # when defining an anchor!)



Afterwards we went through the basics of CSS and some common tags (<p>, <span>, color, background-color, style, stylesheets)
We discussed inline and external stylesheets and how to use them, the hirachy of defined styles, selectors (classes, ID's), how colors are used, hexadecimal system and background styling.

After that we started going through chapter 3 of our book and made a basic html file, that we styled and used an  external sheet to do so as well.
