The majority oftoday was repitition.

* The core skeleton again 
* including metadata and resources like external fonts (google fonts) via url as stylesheet
* defining styles not only for classes, but for tags and IDs
* several attributes of pictures and bg pictures
* new attributes of text/font customization, including but not limited to:
  * font-weight
  * text-transform
  * font-variant
  * text-decoration
  * text-align
  * text-indent

We also learned what cascading styles are, which ones cascade and got an idea of how to handle 'em.


All in all pretty nice, my biggest takeaway was that understanding what is being done while watching a site being made, does not translate well to being able to do it urself.
Practice is mandatory for getting used to the odds and ends of syntax, and which tags generally are available and appropriate ( and ofc convenient :D )
